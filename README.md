## Introduction

This project aims to enhance an existing state of the art robotic system for arm-leg gait training. The enchancement to the robotics system is adding a Virtual reality head mounting device that has been tethered to the patient, this will consist of a custom world in which the patient will engage in gaming where the player presents a virtual reality-integrated robotic system for arm-leg gait training that aims to improve rehabilitation outcomes by incorporating synchronized arm and leg movement. 

## Methodology


## Results

The literature that was surveyed indicates that the tests carried out with virtual reality-integrated robotic systems were carried out on a group of patients with mobility impairments, including stroke and spinal cord injury. The patients underwent a series of gait training sessions using both the robotic system and traditional rehabilitation methods. The main study measured gait speed, balance, and coordination during the training sessions, and found that the robotic system improved these metrics compared to traditional methods.

## Conclusion


Thank you for viewing this project.
